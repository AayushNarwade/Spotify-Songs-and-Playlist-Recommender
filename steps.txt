Fetch tags for all these tracks using get_artist_top_tags (from Last.fm).

Use Sentence-BERT to encode those tags into semantic vectors.

Apply clustering (e.g., KMeans) on those tag vectors.

Extract tags from the userâ€™s description.

Find the most relevant cluster based on similarity with description tags.

Return tracks from that cluster as the recommendation output.
